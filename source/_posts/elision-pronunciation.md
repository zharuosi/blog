## 引言

来看一个简单的例子，fifth怎么发音的？(美音)不是/ˈfɪfθ/，而是/ˈfɪθ/。那么什么是elision呢？来看维基百科上的解释：

    In linguistics, an elision or deletion is the omission of one or more sounds (such as a vowel, a consonant,
    or a whole syllable) in a word or phrase.The word elision is frequently used in linguistic description
    of living languages, and deletion is often used in historical linguistics for a historical sound change.

其中vowel指的是元音，如/a/,/e/,/i/,/o/,/u/等。consonant指的是辅音，除了元音剩下的就是辅音。syllable意为音节（the word water is composed of two syllables: wa and ter）。<!-- more -->

## 规则

1. 辅音+元音的连读（Consonant + Vowel）
2. 辅音+辅音的连读
3. 元音+元音的连读
4. T, D, S 或 Z + Y的连读
