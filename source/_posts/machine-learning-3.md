## Introduction

Here is a not so short note (Rolling Update) for machine learning and artificial intelligience. Main concepts and some references are presented. This note is based on Wikipedia, Andrew Ng's Lecture Notes [CS229 of Standford](http://cs229.stanford.edu/), Machine Learning course of SJTU [IEEE-yangyang](http://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/%7Eyangyang/ml/#), and [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/) of Google.

## Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal), like SVM, regression, decision trees, naive Bayes, etc.
